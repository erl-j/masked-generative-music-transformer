## [ðŸŽ¹ Web application using the Masked Generative Music Transformer](https://erl-j.github.io/loop-savant/)


This project applies techniques from MaskGIT [1] / Muse [2] to symbolic music.

We currently use simple piano rolls of size 36 pitches X 32 timesteps as our target representation.

The goal of the project is to apply a pretrained model to tasks such as:
- Scale/Rhythm constrained generation.
- "Genre" conditioning.
- Velocity generation..
- Microtiming generation etc..

We are also working on applying the model to other music representations.
